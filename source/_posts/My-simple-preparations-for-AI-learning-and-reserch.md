# Prerequisite
Platform: Win10
Environment management software: Anaconda3-5.3.1

# Procedure
1. Install Tensorflow 1.14.0
2. Install Pytorch
3. Install gym for RL

## Install Tensorflow 1.14.0
After the successful installation of Anaconda, **do not create a python environment**. The easier way is to create a environment directly about tensorflow, following the instructions on [TensorFlow in Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/tensorflow-in-anaconda/), which also install python needed.

## Install Pytorch
Just follow the instructions on [Pytorch offical website](https://pytorch.org/).

## Install Gym
Using pip to install gym
```python
pip install gym
```
