## 1. Abstract

Manually analyzed 1059 artifacts that use TF, Keras and PyTorch from Github and related StackOverflow posts.

Structured interviews with 20 researchers and practitionners.

Final taxonomy was validated with a survey involving an addition set of 21 developers.

## 2. Introduction

Use a faceted way, i.e., create categories of the taxonomy in a bottom up way by analysing various sources of info about DL faults.

(Data mining steps in this paper is worth of learning)

(A study about DL programs instead of framework)
