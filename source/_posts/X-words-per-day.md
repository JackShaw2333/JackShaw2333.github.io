On the verge of the Galaxy, a tiny planet wanders. This tiny planet is **populated** with Zori people. Throughout thousands of years, those intelligent people have constructed millions of **metropolises**. Distinct from human beings living on Earth, all Zori people are ruled by a **despot**, whose power only transfered within the royal family. Oppressed by the tyrant family for a long time, those Zori who have had enough of this rigid system are plotting against the despot.

Long time ago, in order to consolidate his domination over Zori people, the despot at that time invented a religion, which has been deemed as the **orthodox** ideology of Zori society since back then. But now, revolutionary ideology has been **encroaching** on all Zori people's mind, especially those who are not staunch royalists and suffer more.

Iroz, a nobody currently, **epitomizes** the marginal Zori people. He is **morose** and **otherworldly**, totally in **oblivion** on Zori planet. Most marginal people like Iroz hardly make ends meet.
